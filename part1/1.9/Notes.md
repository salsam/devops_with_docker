# Minimalistic c++ and python environment

I usually tend to work a lot on a single machine to the point of forgetting dependencies I am using. Thus this environment is fairly stripped to minimal requirements. For c++ development g++ and is in ubuntu 18.04 by default and 
only absolutely necessary dependency is clang-format for code formatting. For python ipython is included since it is almost always useful when programming with python. Due to my lack of focus on single branch, I did not include task specific libraries like flask, pandas, numpy etc. Similarly C++ dependencies like Boost were not included due to not always being required.
